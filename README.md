# Blood Sugar Level Units In The World

This repository generates a website at https://units.glucometers.tech/ to specify the
unit of measure of blood sugar levels in different countries of the world.

## TODO

* Replace the pygal-based generation of the worldmap with something more reasonable that
  does not include Antarctica.
* Actually provide instructions on how to contribute.
* Find a way to tie this to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) instead of being a
  separate repository.
