# Blood Sugar Level Units Worldwide

Blood sugar level (also known as glycaemia) is the measure of glucose concentrated in
the blood.

There are two main unit of measures used for this attribute: mg/dL and mmol/L, which
have a fixed 18:1 ratio. Different countries use different units, and there isn't a
clear to know which country uses what, until now!
